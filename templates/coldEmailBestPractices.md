# Cold Email Best Practices

*Best practices for crafting effective cold outreach emails for WFCO*

## Core Philosophy

- **Conversation over conversion** – initiate dialogue, not immediate sales
- **Value-first mindset** – frame around helping prospects succeed
- **Permission-based engagement** – give explicit permission to decline
- **Agentic experimentation** – we test hypotheses, not run playbooks

## Psychology of Attention

### The Curiosity Gap

The curiosity gap is a neurological phenomenon discovered by George Loewenstein. When we perceive a gap between what we know and what we want to know, it creates a state of deprivation that drives action. This is the most powerful lever in cold email.

**Three ingredients for an effective curiosity gap:**

1. **Anchor in concrete** – Reference something specific they'll recognize (their company, role, a recent event)
2. **Challenge their worldview** – Imply you know something that contradicts what they believe
3. **Create stakes** – The gap must matter enough to close

**The gap size must match the payoff.** Too small a gap feels trivial. Too large feels clickbait. The resolution should deliver on what the opening promises.

**Opening line examples using curiosity gap:**

| Weak (No Gap) | Strong (Creates Gap) |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "I noticed you're hiring SDRs" | "I noticed you're hiring 5 SDRs but your CRM shows 40% of leads never get touched" |
| "I help companies with outbound" | "Most of your competitors are doing outbound wrong – and it's actually helping you" |
| "Saw your recent funding" | "Your Series B announcement mentioned 3x ARR growth – but your ICP signals suggest that's conservative" |

The goal: make them think "What did they see that I'm missing?"

### Awareness Levels (Eugene Schwartz)

Your message must match where the prospect is in their awareness journey:

| Level | They Know | Your Approach |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Unaware** | Nothing – don't know they have a problem | Lead with symptom, not solution |
| **Problem-aware** | They have a problem, not what causes it | Agitate the problem, hint at solution |
| **Solution-aware** | Solutions exist, not yours specifically | Differentiate your approach |
| **Product-aware** | Your product, not convinced yet | Overcome objections, build trust |
| **Most aware** | Ready to buy, need the right offer | Give them a reason to act now |

**Cold email targets problem-aware or solution-aware prospects.** If they're unaware, you need to create awareness of the problem first. If they're most aware, they're already inbound.

### Emotional Decision-Making in B2B

95% of B2B purchase decisions are made emotionally, then justified with logic (Harvard Business School research). This doesn't mean being manipulative – it means acknowledging that humans make decisions.

**Key emotional drivers in B2B:**

- **Loss aversion** – People are 2.5x more sensitive to potential losses than equivalent gains (Kahneman/Tversky). Frame around what they're losing by not acting.
- **Risk of inaction** – "What happens if you do nothing?" is more powerful than "What happens if you try this?"
- **Fear of being left behind** – Competitors moving faster creates urgency without artificial pressure
- **Identity and status** – People want to be seen as forward-thinking, strategic, successful

**Frame benefits as avoided losses:**

| Feature-focused (Weak) | Loss-aversion (Strong) |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| "Save 10 hours per week" | "Your SDRs are losing 10 hours per week to manual research" |
| "Increase pipeline by 30%" | "You're leaving 30% of qualified pipeline on the table" |
| "Better lead scoring" | "Your competitors are capturing signals you're missing" |

## Language Guidelines

### Natural Language

- Write like you're talking to a colleague in person – use words you'd actually say out loud
- Avoid parenthetical explanations like "(formerly Company X)" that no one uses in real conversation
- Use simple, direct language that flows naturally when read aloud
- Avoid corporate speak or overly formal constructions that sound artificial

### Tone and Voice

- Conversational tone with more "you" than "I"
- Direct, not blunt – get to the point fast, but stay human
- Curious, not assumptive – ask about their situation rather than prescribe solutions
- Pragmatic over promotional – acknowledge they're busy and skeptical

### Preferred Phrases

- "I'm wondering if", "I noticed", "seems like"
- "might be worth", "happy to share what's worked"
- "no worries if not", "figured I'd reach out"
- "wanted to see if", "thought this might be relevant"

### Forbidden Patterns

**Marketing speak to avoid:**
- "pioneering", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge", "breakthrough"
- "industry-leading", "best-in-class", "game-changing", "innovative solutions"
- "impressive", "amazing", "incredible" (over-the-top adjectives signal AI)

**Structural red flags:**
- Generic language that could apply to anyone
- Leading with capabilities instead of their situation
- Artificial urgency or sounding pushy
- Parenthetical company explanations or corporate suffixes (Inc., LLC, Corp.)
- Positioning that diminishes prospect's current work
- Em dashes (—) – use en dashes (–) instead, em dashes signal AI writing

**Phrases to avoid:**
- "I hope this finds you well"
- "Just wanted to reach out"
- "Per my research"
- "Quick question" (usually followed by a pitch, people know this)
- "I'd love to pick your brain"
- "Please advise"

## Email Structure

### Length

- **Target:** 50-100 words ideal, 125 words maximum
- **Sentences:** 5 maximum
- Shorter is almost always better

### Subject Line

- 1-5 words maximum
- Create curiosity, align with body text
- Sentence case – not Title Case
- No ALL CAPS ever

### Body Structure

**Research-problem connection logic:** Observation → Implication → Problem → Relevance

1. **First line:** Hook based on something about them (not about us)
2. **Middle:** Bridge to what we do and why it's relevant to their situation
3. **Last line:** Soft ask or genuine question

### Call to Action

- Ask about value, not meetings
- "Worth a conversation?" not "Can we schedule 30 minutes?"
- "Curious how you're handling X?" not "I'd love to show you our solution"
- Never include pricing, product details, features, or case studies in first email

### Sign-off

- Just "Joe" – no "Best," "Thanks," or "Cheers"
- No elaborate signatures or titles in cold outreach

## Copywriting Frameworks for Short-Form

These frameworks help structure messages in 50-100 words while maintaining persuasive flow.

### QVC (Question, Value, Closing)

Best for ultra-short emails (3-4 sentences). Proven to achieve 14%+ response rates.

1. **Question** – Open with a question that shows you understand their situation (not an introduction)
2. **Value** – One to three sentences on the benefit, focused on "you" not "we"
3. **Closing** – End with another question that invites response

**Example:**
> Scaling the sales team while SDRs spend half their time on research instead of selling?
>
> We've helped similar B2B teams cut research time by 80% with automated enrichment that surfaces buying signals.
>
> Worth exploring?

### PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution)

Best when you need to create urgency around a pain point.

1. **Problem** – Name the specific problem they face
2. **Agitate** – Make the problem feel more pressing (what happens if nothing changes?)
3. **Solution** – Position your approach as the path forward

**Example:**
> Your SDRs are spending 3+ hours per day researching accounts that never close.
>
> That's 15 hours per rep per week – and competitors with better signals are getting there first.
>
> We build enrichment workflows that surface buying signals automatically. Interested in seeing what that looks like for [Company]?

### PPP (Praise, Picture, Push)

Best when you have genuine positive intel about the prospect.

1. **Praise** – Genuine compliment on something specific (not flattery)
2. **Picture** – Connect their success to an even bigger opportunity
3. **Push** – Clear next step to capture that opportunity

**Example:**
> Saw [Company] hit 3x ARR growth last quarter – that's exceptional execution.
>
> Teams at that inflection point usually find their outbound infrastructure becomes the bottleneck. What got you to $10M breaks at $30M.
>
> We've helped similar teams rebuild their enrichment layer for scale. Worth a conversation?

### The Specificity Principle

Specific beats generic. Always. Research by David Ogilvy showed specificity increases believability and response.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Save time" | "Save 6 hours per week" |
| "Increase revenue" | "Increase pipeline by 28%" |
| "Many companies" | "47 B2B SaaS companies" |
| "Recently" | "Last Tuesday" |
| "A lot of leads" | "340 qualified leads" |

Specificity signals you've done the work. Vague claims feel like mass email.

## Personalization

### Research Logic

Always follow: **Observation → Implication → Problem → Relevance**

- Start with something you noticed about their company or role
- Connect it to a challenge they likely face
- Bridge to how that's relevant to what we do
- Make it easy for them to engage without committing

### Use Case Specificity

Always name the specific use case rather than generic benefits:

| Bad (Generic) | Good (Specific) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "scale your outbound" | "track buying signals across your target accounts" |
| "improve pipeline efficiency" | "automate SDR research so they focus on selling" |
| "enhance your GTM" | "build enrichment that surfaces signals unique to your ICP" |
| "optimize revenue operations" | "route inbound leads based on real-time qualification" |

Match the specific use case to the recipient's persona and role.

### Timing Considerations

- Avoid referencing events/activities older than 2-3 months – they feel stale and forced
- Focus on current role, company context, and industry trends
- Use recent company news, funding, or industry developments when available
- When in doubt, lead with universal pain points rather than dated references

### Work Experience Relevance

| Recency | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| **0-2 years** | Highly relevant, reference freely |
| **2-4 years** | Only if directly relevant to our value prop |
| **4+ years** | Don't reference unless absolutely critical |

- Avoid repetitive references to the same previous role
- Prioritize current role over older positions
- Exception: Reference older roles only when they represent unique domain expertise

## WFCO-Specific Fit Assessment

### Good Fit Signals

Before crafting outreach, confirm the prospect/company shows these characteristics:

- **Funding stage:** Series A-D
- **ARR:** $5-100M range
- **Headcount:** 50-300 employees
- **GTM model:** Sales-led or hybrid (not pure PLG)
- **Existing infrastructure:** Has CRM with historical data
- **Clear ICP:** Can articulate who they sell to
- **Champion potential:** VP+ level who can approve spend

### Poor Fit Signals (Deprioritize or Skip)

- **Pre-seed/early seed:** No established GTM process to amplify
- **Pure PLG:** No sales team to enable
- **Enterprise (5000+ employees):** Long procurement cycles, not our model
- **No CRM:** Nothing to enrich or automate against
- **"AI will replace everyone" mindset:** We position as enablement, not replacement

### Persona-Specific Hooks

| Persona | Lead With | Avoid |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **VP Marketing** | Team leverage, lead quality, competitive moats | Replacement messaging |
| **VP Sales** | Rep productivity, pipeline, buying signals | "AI SDRs" framing |
| **RevOps/Ops** | Data quality, reliability, systems that last | Overpromising on automation |
| **Founders (Series A-B)** | Execution speed, infrastructure rescue | Strategy consulting positioning |

---

## Quality Control

### Grammar and Clarity

- Ensure opening sentences are grammatically correct and make logical sense
- Avoid incomplete thoughts or awkward phrasing
- Test email readability by reading aloud
- **Never start with fragments** like "David, leading..." – use complete sentences

### Pre-Send Checklist

Before sending any cold email, verify:

- [ ] Research logic clear (Observation → Implication → Problem → Relevance)
- [ ] Under 125 words (ideally under 100)
- [ ] No product features or pricing
- [ ] Includes permission to decline or soft CTA
- [ ] Conversational tone – would you actually say this out loud?
- [ ] No em dashes (use en dashes)
- [ ] No marketing superlatives
- [ ] Specific use case, not generic benefits
- [ ] Reference is recent (< 2-3 months old)
- [ ] Fit assessment passed

### Red Flags to Catch

- Generic language that could apply to any company
- Leading with our capabilities instead of their situation
- Artificial urgency
- Sounding pushy or salesy
- Marketing speak that signals "mass email"

- Context adaptation for company size and role
- Track what resonates by persona
- Iterate based on replies, not just opens
