## How to Use This Document

1. **Pick a gap** that matches your campaign's target cohort
2. **Identify the public proxy** that signals this gap exists
3. **Build the cohort** around that proxy (job postings, funding data, org signals)
4. **Craft messaging** using the curiosity trigger as inspiration
5. **Test variations** of the trigger across the cohort

## Gap 1: The Untested Playbook

**The insight:** You've been running the same outbound playbook for 18 months. You've never actually tested whether a completely different angle would 3x your results.

**Why it's a real gap:** Most companies find something that "works" (5% reply rate) and optimize around it forever. They never test whether a fundamentally different approach would work better. They're optimizing a local maximum.

**The counterintuitive part:** Your "winning" sequence might be your worst one. You just don't know because you've never tested it against real alternatives.

**Public proxies:**
- They've been doing outbound for 12+ months (visible from SDR tenure/hiring history)
- Messaging on their website/LinkedIn has been consistent (no experimentation visible)
- They talk about "scaling" outbound, not "testing" outbound

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "You've sent 50,000 emails with the same angle. What if a different angle would 3x that? You've never tested it."
- "Your outbound has been running the same playbook since 2023. Have you tested it against alternatives, or just assumed it's optimal?"

---

## Gap 2: The Learning Void

**The insight:** You've run 30 campaigns. What did you learn? Can you articulate it? Is it written down anywhere? Or did that knowledge walk out the door with your last SDR?

**Why it's a real gap:** Most outbound teams generate data but not knowledge. Each campaign starts from scratch. The "playbook" is whatever the current team remembers.

**The counterintuitive part:** Your outbound is a liability, not an asset. You're not accumulating learnings—you're just accumulating sends.

**Public proxies:**
- SDR turnover (visible on LinkedIn - average tenure < 18 months)
- No "playbook" or "documentation" language in job postings
- RevOps roles focused on CRM/reporting, not outbound systems

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "You've run outbound for 2 years. If I asked 'what did you learn?' would the answer be documented anywhere, or would it be 'ask Sarah'?"
- "Your last SDR left 3 months ago. How much of what they learned left with them?"

---

## Gap 3: The Single-Bet Problem

**The insight:** You're running one sequence to one cohort with one angle. That's not outbound strategy—that's a single bet with no hedge.

**Why it's a real gap:** Real experimentation means running multiple hypotheses simultaneously. Most teams run one thing, see if it works, then try something else. That's sequential guessing, not systematic learning.

**The counterintuitive part:** Running 5 micro-experiments beats running 1 big campaign. But your infrastructure only supports big campaigns.

**Public proxies:**
- High volume outbound (visible from SDR count, tools)
- Generic ICP (broad targeting visible on website)
- No mention of "experimentation" or "testing" in GTM job postings

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "You're sending 10,000 emails/month with one message. What if you sent 2,000 each to 5 different angles and learned which actually works?"
- "One sequence, one bet. If this doesn't work, what's your plan B? Or is it just 'try something else'?"

---

## Gap 4: The Speed Gap

**The insight:** Your competitors can spin up a new experiment in hours. You need 2 weeks. Speed of learning is the new moat, and you're losing.

**Why it's a real gap:** In outbound, the team that tests fastest wins. If it takes you 2 weeks to launch a new angle and your competitor does it in 2 hours, they'll find what works before you do.

**The counterintuitive part:** It's not about sending more emails. It's about testing more hypotheses. Volume without velocity is just noise.

**Public proxies:**
- They're hiring for capacity (more SDRs) not capability (systems, ops)
- Manual processes visible in job descriptions ("scrappy," "hands-on," "wear many hats")
- No automation/experimentation tooling mentioned

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "How long does it take you to test a new outbound angle? 2 weeks? Your competitors that are systematized do it in 2 hours. That gap compounds."
- "You're hiring your 4th SDR. Are you also building the infrastructure for them to learn faster than competitors?"

---

## Gap 5: The Attribution Black Box

**The insight:** You know your reply rate is 4%. But do you know WHY? Was it the subject line? The pain point? The CTA? The timing? You can't improve what you can't attribute.

**Why it's a real gap:** Most teams track outcomes (replies, meetings) but not the variables that drove them. So they can't systematically improve—they can only guess.

**The counterintuitive part:** High performers don't have better intuition. They have better attribution. They know which lever moved the number.

**Public proxies:**
- They track pipeline/revenue but job postings don't mention outbound analytics
- Reporting is outcome-focused (meetings booked) not experiment-focused
- No dedicated function for outbound optimization

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "Your reply rate went up 20% last month. Do you know which variable caused it? Or are you hoping it happens again?"
- "You know how many meetings you booked. Do you know which message, angle, or cohort drove them?"

---

## Gap 6: The Context Ceiling

**The insight:** Your outbound uses the same message whether the prospect just raised funding or just laid off 20% of the team. That's why it feels generic—because it is.

**Why it's a real gap:** True personalization isn't [First Name] and [Company]. It's adapting the entire angle based on what's actually happening at that company right now.

**The counterintuitive part:** The "personalization" most teams do is cosmetic. Real personalization means different messages for different contexts—and that requires a system.

**Public proxies:**
- Their outbound (if we've received it) uses surface-level personalization
- High volume suggests templated approach
- No enrichment/signal tools mentioned in job postings

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "Your email to a company that just raised $50M is identical to one that just had layoffs. They have opposite priorities right now."
- "You personalize with name and company. But do you personalize based on what's actually happening at that company this month?"

---

## Gap 7: The Iteration Trap

**The insight:** You're iterating on subject lines when you should be iterating on angles. You're optimizing the wrong layer.

**Why it's a real gap:** Most A/B testing is superficial—subject line A vs B, CTA phrasing. The bigger lever is the fundamental approach: pain point, persona, offer. But that requires more sophisticated experimentation.

**The counterintuitive part:** Your 15% improvement from subject line testing is hiding the 300% improvement you'd get from angle testing.

**Public proxies:**
- They mention A/B testing but only at surface level
- Outreach tools focused on sending, not experimentation
- No mention of "hypothesis" or "experiment design" in how they talk about outbound

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "You've A/B tested 50 subject lines. Have you ever tested whether a completely different value prop would outperform all of them?"
- "You're optimizing at the subject line layer. The bigger lever is the angle layer—but that's harder to test with your current setup."

---

## Gap 8: The Ops Hole

**The insight:** You've posted 15 sales roles this year. Zero ops roles. Who's building the machine the reps run on?

**Why it's a real gap:** Everyone knows they need SDRs. Fewer realize that SDRs without infrastructure just create more chaos. The absence of ops hiring is a leading indicator of scaling pain.

**Public proxies:**
- Compare sales/SDR job postings to RevOps/Sales Ops/Marketing Ops postings
- Ratio of sales hires to ops hires over last 12 months
- Job postings emphasize "building" without systems support

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "You're hiring reps 5x faster than you're hiring ops. That math breaks around month 4."
- "5 new SDRs, 0 new ops. Who's building the playbook they'll run?"

---

## Gap 9: The Adjacent Hire Prediction

**The insight:** Hiring patterns are predictable. VP Sales → RevOps within 90 days. SDR team → Enablement within 6 months. We know what's coming before you post it.

**Why it's a real gap:** Nobody thinks of their own hiring as a pattern, but it is. If we can predict their next pain point before they feel it, we look prescient.

**Public proxies:**
- Track when they posted VP Sales / Head of Growth / etc.
- Count the days since that hire
- Look for typical follow-on patterns

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "You hired [Name] as VP Sales 11 weeks ago. Companies at your stage typically realize they need outbound infrastructure around week 12. Timing."
- "The VP Sales hire was 3 months ago. The ops pain usually shows up around now. How's it feeling?"

---

## Gap 10: The G2 Complaint List

**The insight:** Competitor reviews aren't just research—they're lead lists. Every 1-star review is someone with acute pain and a reason to switch.

**Why it's a real gap:** People read G2 for buying decisions. Nobody thinks to use it as a prospecting source for competitor displacement.

**Public proxies:**
- G2 reviews (public)
- Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, Reddit threads
- Filter by recency and specific complaints

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "23 people left 2-star reviews for [Competitor] mentioning [specific pain] in the last 90 days. That's not research—that's a list."
- "Your competitor's G2 reviews mention [specific issue] 47 times. Those reviewers are prospects with acute pain."

---

## Gap 11: The Cohort Clock

**The insight:** Companies at the same stage hit the same walls at predictable times. Series A + 6 months = outbound chaos. Series B + 12 months = attribution crisis. We know when the pain hits before you do.

**Why it's a real gap:** Founders think their problems are unique. They're not. The timeline is almost universal.

**Public proxies:**
- Funding date + headcount trajectory
- Time since last funding round
- Growth rate visible from hiring

**Curiosity triggers:**
- "Series B companies hit the 'outbound isn't scaling' wall around month 8-10. You're at month 7. The symptoms usually start with..."
- "Companies at your stage typically realize their outbound infrastructure is broken around now. How's yours holding up?"

## Building Campaigns from Gaps

### Step 1: Choose Your Gap
Pick based on the persona you're targeting and the signals you can capture.

### Step 2: Define the Cohort
Use public proxies to build a list. Examples:
- "Companies that raised Series B 6-9 months ago with 3+ SDR job postings"
- "Companies with VP Sales hired in last 90 days and no RevOps posting"
- "Companies with 5+ SDRs and no ops/enablement roles"

### Step 3: Craft the Hook
Use the curiosity trigger as inspiration. Adapt to their specific situation.

### Step 4: Test Variations
Run A/B/C tests on:
- Different framing of the same gap
- Different CTAs (permission-first vs. full-upfront vs. tease)
- Different specificity levels

### Step 5: Learn and Iterate
Document what works. Update this document with new gap patterns that emerge.
